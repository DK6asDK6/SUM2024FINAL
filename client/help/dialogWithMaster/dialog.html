    &ndash; Come with me, bearer of of your gods' words. &ndash; It wasn't seem
    from this witch to have a warm reaction to group standing right in front of
    her. &ndash; But only you, no one else should know this.

    After this words lady turned back and entered the darkness of her sanctuary.

  <div class="question">
    In my experience, everyone can see messages here, so how can we send
    personal messages to keep some secrets?
  </div>

  <br />
  <br />

  <div class="info">
    Sometimes it is needed to send personal message to get some secret
    information from master or from another player. In much more cases, it is
    needed for master to give personal information to player, for example,
    secrets told in personal way.
    <br />
    DK6Dragon's Dungeon supports this. Let's take an example:
    <br />
    <div class="cmd">.user:myFriend I send you personal message.</div>
    or:
    <div class="cmd">.u:myFriend I send you personal message.</div>

    First, we initiate <b>.user</b> or <b>.u</b> command. Then we mention name
    of person who you are sending message like <b>:username</b> as it was shown.
  </div>
  <div class="info">
    Also you can send message to master even without his mentioning. There's
    another command:
    <div class="cmd">.master I send personal message to Game Master.</div>
    or:
    <div class="cmd">.m I send personal message to Game Master.</div>
  </div>
</body>
